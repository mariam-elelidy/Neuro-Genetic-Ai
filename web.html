            <p>The homepage serves as the primary interface for patients and rehabilitation centers. Upon landing, users are greeted with an intuitive dashboard that allows for quick navigation to the three main sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patient Data Submission: Here, users can input basic information as well as genetic data for personalized rehabilitation tracking.</li>
                <li>Connection to N-GAIPTS Devices: Seamlessly linking to IoT devices, such as Arduino-based systems, to allow real-time data monitoring. This includes connecting to sensors for functional electrical stimulation (FES) and electromyography (EMG).</li>
                <li>Overview of AI, ML, and Cloud Features: A brief introduction to how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms are integrated into the rehabilitation process to predict outcomes, assess progress, and enhance patient care. Cloud storage ensures data security and availability, while real-time monitoring offers immediate feedback.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="patient" class="section">
            <h2>Patient Section – Comprehensive Data Management</h2>
            <p>This section allows patients to submit and manage their rehabilitation data efficiently. It is divided into the following subsections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Data Submission: Users first enter their personal details, including medical history and initial assessment data.</li>
                <li>Genetic Data Submission: Patients can then submit genetic information, which is crucial for personalized treatment. The genetic data is processed and used by the integrated AI models to customize rehabilitation protocols and predict recovery outcomes.</li>
                <li>Data Storage: The system features a well-organized data storage system that houses both old and new patient data. Historical data is stored for reference, while new data is updated in real-time. This feature ensures a structured and scalable approach to data management, enabling doctors and therapists to monitor progress over time.</li>
                <li>Progress Analysis and Visualization: A dedicated section for real-time analysis of the patient’s rehabilitation journey, with visual reports and graphs that show the improvements in motor functions, neural activity, pain relief, and other health metrics.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="centers" class="section">
            <h2>Centers Section – Real-time EMG Analysis and Rehabilitation Insights</h2>
            <p>Designed specifically for rehabilitation centers, this section provides advanced tools for monitoring patient progress and ensuring effective treatment. The primary focus is on electromyography (EMG) data, which is analyzed in real-time to assess muscle responses and rehabilitation progress:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-Time EMG Monitoring: Centers can view patient muscle activity and reactions to functional electrical stimulation (FES) in real-time, allowing therapists to adjust treatment as needed.</li>
                <li>Progressive Insights and Trends: A detailed view of trends, including changes in muscle tone, strength, and rehabilitation effectiveness. The system’s ML algorithms track these changes and provide predictions for future improvement.</li>
                <li>Automated Alerts: The platform uses AI to detect abnormal patterns in EMG data, sending automated alerts to healthcare providers for timely interventions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="technology" class="section">
            <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
            <p>The platform’s robust architecture integrates multiple advanced technologies, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML): These technologies drive the heart of the rehabilitation process by analyzing vast amounts of data from patients and suggesting the most effective rehabilitation protocols. The AI models predict recovery trajectories and optimize treatment plans based on real-time data.</li>
                <li>Cloud Integration: All patient data, including genetic and rehabilitation progress, is securely stored in the cloud, ensuring easy access for healthcare providers and patients alike. Cloud storage enables data scalability, real-time updates, and high availability.</li>
                <li>IoT Device Integration: The website connects to IoT devices, such as Arduino-based sensors, to monitor FES and EMG data in real-time. This integration supports remote monitoring and personalized treatment adjustments.</li>
                <li>Real-Time Data Processing: The system ensures that data from devices such as sensors and wearable technologies are processed instantly, providing immediate feedback to patients and therapists.</li>
                <li>Secure Data Management: HIPAA-compliant encryption and secure cloud storage systems ensure patient confidentiality and data integrity.</li>
            </ul>
